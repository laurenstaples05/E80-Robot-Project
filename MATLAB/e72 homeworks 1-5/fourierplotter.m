function ISE = fourierplotter( A, T, d, M )
% This function plots a periodic signal and a complex exponential series 
% approximation of it. It also produces a stem plot of the Fourier coefficients.
% It is designed for a pulse width modulation signal centered around t = 0 
% (a pulse is centered there), but can be modified as needed for other periodic signals.
%   A: amplitude of pulse train
%   T: fundamental period
%   d: duty cycle
%   M: number of harmonics in the Fourier series approximation
% The function returns the integrated square error (ISE) for the approximation

% E72 Sp 2025, Profs. Bassman and Yong
% Based on a function created by Prof. Qimin Yang in Sp 2017.


N0 = 5000;    % number of points within a period. Increase to capture variations for higher harmonics
dt = T/N0;    % time resolution
tau = d * T   % duration of non-zero pulse
wo = 2*pi/T     % fundamental frequency


% Calculate Fourier coefficients. k goes from -M to M, but the vector of 
% coefficients has to start with index 1
k = -M:1:M;
c = (A./(k*pi)).*sin((pi*k*tau)/T);
% C_0 is not calculated by this formula and needs to be done separately 
% due to division by zero.
% Indexing is tricky! C_k is in the (k+M+1)th element of the c vector
c(0+M+1) = A* (tau/T) ;

% Make a vector of times for the plots
t = -T-tau:dt:T+tau; % two full periods plus a bit extra

% Build the approximated signal from the Fourier coefficients and basis functions
xhat = zeros(1,length(t));
for n = -M:1:M  % using n to avoid messing up k vector
    xhat = xhat + c(n+M+1).*exp(1j*n*wo*t); 
end

% Generate a vector of zeros and ones corresponding to the pulse being off
% or on in the original signal. We are using logical AND (&) and OR (|) statements
% to calculate x without having to use a for loop and if statements.
x = ((t>=(-T-tau/2))&(t<=(-T+tau/2))) | ((t>=-tau/2)&(t<=tau/2)) | ((t>=(T-tau/2))&(t<=(T+tau/2)));
