% E72 Homework 2 Spring 2025 - Approximate PWM signal with sum of sinusoids
% Set parameters for a pulse width modulation signal centered around t = 0 
% (a pulse is centered there), specify a number of cosines/sines to use to 
% build an approximation, find the optimal amplitudes and phases of the 
% component sinusoids, and plot the results for one period.

close all

% These parameters may be modified
M = 7;       % number of harmonics (aka modes) in the approximation
A = 1;       % amplitude of PWM pulse train
T = 1;       % period of signal (in seconds)
d = 0.5;     % duty cycle (fraction of period when pulse is "on"), feel free to play with this number.
dt = T/5000; % spacing between evaluation points (these are the red points in the HW file)
% This value of dt produces 10001 points in the vector "t" below. 
% This should be accurate enough for this problem. No need to change.

% These lines repeat some of the quantities calculated in calcISE.m for the
% sake of plotting. That's not ideal but it's done here to look
% straightforward. Importantly, the parameters set above are only set in one
% place to avoid inconsistency errors

% Refer to calcISE.m for explanation of these quantities
tau = d * T    % Duration of time in one period when the pulse is "on". Define tau here in terms of d and T.
omega0 = (2*pi)/T % Define the fundamental frequency omega_0 here (see HW file)
t = -T/2:dt:T/2;  % vector of time values (the red dots in the HW file)
pwm =  A*((t>=-tau/2)&(t<=tau/2));

%% In this section, expressions are written for the specific case of M=3
% Initial guess for the decision variables, which are entries are amplitudes 
% of the constant term, then the cosines, then the sines.
ab0 = A/2*ones(1,2*M+1); %altered this to be for any M value, not just 3

% If, as you move to larger M values, you get an error about exceeding
% MaxFunEvals, uncomment this line, and look at the help for fminsearch and 
% learn how to have it use specified options and understand what it is doing.
 options = optimset('MaxFunEvals',10000);

% TASK b) 
% To understand why we need "f" below, refer to Problem 3 from SKills 1 and
% read the "Minimize with Extra Parameters" section of the fminsearch Matlab documentation.
% Write a clear explanation of what these two lines are doing in your homework writeup.
